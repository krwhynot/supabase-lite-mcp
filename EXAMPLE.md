# Supabase Lite MCP - Practical Example

## Understanding the Impact

When you start a conversation with Claude using the full Supabase MCP server, you're essentially loading a Swiss Army knife with 26 different tools. This is like bringing an entire toolbox when you only need a screwdriver and a hammer. Each tool takes up space in Claude's "working memory" (the context window), leaving less room for your actual conversation and data.

With Supabase Lite, you're bringing just the essential tools for database work. This focused approach means Claude has more memory available for understanding your schema, analyzing your queries, and providing detailed assistance.

## Real-World Comparison

### Before: Full Supabase MCP
When Claude loads the full Supabase MCP, it sees:
- Organization management commands (create_org, delete_org, etc.)
- Project lifecycle commands (create_project, pause_project, etc.)
- Branch management (create_branch, merge_branch, etc.)
- Edge function deployment
- Cost tracking
- Plus your 8 essential database commands

Total context used: ~14,800 tokens

### After: Supabase Lite MCP
When Claude loads your custom server, it sees only:
- list_tables
- list_extensions
- list_migrations
- apply_migration
- execute_sql
- get_logs
- get_advisors
- generate_typescript_types

Total context used: ~3,700 tokens

## Example Workflow

Here's how you would use your new Supabase Lite server in practice:

### 1. Start a new project
```bash
mkdir ~/Projects/my-database-project
cd ~/Projects/my-database-project
```

### 2. Configure MCP for this project
```bash
~/mcp-select.sh supabase-lite sequential-thinking
```

This creates a `.mcp.json` with just your lightweight Supabase server and the thinking tool.

### 3. Open Claude and work with your database

You can now ask Claude things like:

**"Can you show me all tables in my database?"**
Claude will use `list_tables` to query your schema.

**"I need to create a users table with authentication fields"**
Claude will use `apply_migration` to create the table with proper structure.

**"Generate TypeScript types for my schema"**
Claude will use `generate_typescript_types` to create type-safe interfaces.

**"Are there any security issues with my database?"**
Claude will use `get_advisors` with type='security' to check for problems.

## The Hidden Benefit: Faster Responses

Because Claude has to process less tool documentation at the start of each conversation, you'll notice:
- Faster initial response times
- More detailed answers (more context space for actual content)
- Better handling of large query results
- Ability to maintain longer conversations without hitting limits

## Monitoring Token Usage

You can actually see the difference in token usage. When you start a conversation:

With full Supabase:
```
System: Loading MCP servers...
[26 tools loaded, ~14,800 tokens consumed]
Remaining context: ~185,200 tokens
```

With Supabase Lite:
```
System: Loading MCP servers...
[8 tools loaded, ~3,700 tokens consumed]
Remaining context: ~196,300 tokens
```

That's 11,100 extra tokens available for your actual work!

## When to Use Each Configuration

### Use Supabase Lite when:
- Working primarily with database schemas
- Running SQL queries and migrations
- Generating TypeScript types
- Checking database health and security
- You need maximum context space for data

### Use Full Supabase when:
- Managing multiple projects
- Deploying edge functions
- Working with branches
- Handling organization-level operations
- Cost tracking is important

## Advanced Tip: Multiple Configurations

You can create different versions of the lite server for different workflows:

**supabase-query**: Just execute_sql and list_tables (minimal)
**supabase-admin**: Add project management commands
**supabase-dev**: Include edge function commands

Each configuration serves a specific purpose and uses only the tokens it needs.

## Testing Your Setup

Once your server is running, test it with these commands in Claude:

1. **Basic connectivity test:**
   "Using the supabase-lite server, can you list available commands?"

2. **Database structure test:**
   "Show me all tables in the public schema"

3. **Security check:**
   "Run a security advisor check on my database"

4. **Type generation test:**
   "Generate TypeScript types for my database schema"

If all these work, your custom server is fully operational!

## The Learning Journey

By building this custom MCP server, you've learned:
- How MCP servers bridge Claude and external services
- The importance of token economy in AI conversations
- How to customize tools for specific workflows
- The architecture of client-server communication in AI systems

This knowledge empowers you to create other custom integrations, optimize your AI workflows, and better understand the tools you use daily.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Command not found"
Your server is running but Claude can't see it. Check:
- Is the server in your .mcp.json?
- Did you restart Claude after adding it?
- Are the paths correct in the configuration?

### "Authentication failed"
The server is running but can't connect to Supabase. Verify:
- Your SUPABASE_URL is correct
- You're using the service key, not the anon key
- The key hasn't been rotated recently

### "Server won't start"
The server itself has issues. Check:
- Did `npm run build` complete successfully?
- Is Node.js version 16 or higher?
- Are all dependencies installed?

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working custom MCP server:

1. **Customize further**: Remove commands you never use, add ones you need
2. **Create variants**: Build different servers for different project types
3. **Share with team**: Package your server for colleagues with similar needs
4. **Contribute back**: Share improvements with the community

Remember, the goal isn't just to save tokens â€“ it's to create a more focused, efficient workflow that lets you and Claude work better together. Every token saved is more room for creativity, analysis, and problem-solving.
